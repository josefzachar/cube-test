Sound Files for Square Golf

This directory contains placeholder files for the game's sound effects.
Replace these files with actual sound files to hear sounds in the game.

The game supports both MP3 and WAV formats, with MP3 being preferred if both exist.

Required sound files (either .mp3 or .wav format):
- grass_hit: Sound of the ball hitting grass
- dirt_hit: Sound of the ball hitting dirt
- sand_hit: Sound of the ball hitting sand
- water_hit: Sound of the ball hitting water
- stone_hit: Sound of the ball hitting stone

Examples:
- grass_hit.mp3 or grass_hit.wav
- dirt_hit.mp3 or dirt_hit.wav
- etc.

The game will automatically load these files when it starts.
If a sound file is missing, the game will use a silent placeholder.
